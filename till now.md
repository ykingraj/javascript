# Variables
* Containers for holding values
* Concept of LET VAR and CONST
* Naming rules 
* Case Sensitive 
* Cant start with number
* Can be combination of String and Numbers
* Javascript is a dynamicly typed language, which means the single variable can be assigned different values throught out the programm (different datatypes).
They are processed during the runtime.
 
# Data types
* Primitive Datatypes 
    -
    - String
    - Numbers
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
* Non Primitive Datatypes
    -
    - Array
    - Objects
    - Functions
    - Sets
    - Maps
* Special Datatype
    -
    - BigInt

# Operatores
* Arithmetic Operators
    - 
    - Addition +
    - Subtraction -
    - Division /
    - Multiplication *
    - Exponent **
    - Modules or Remainder %
    - Increment ++
    - Decrement --
    - Post and Pre increment/decrement (++x vs x++)
* Comparison Operators
    - 
    - Equal ==
    - Strict Equal ===
    - Greater than >
    - Lesser than <
    - Not Equal !=
    - Strict Not Equal !==
    - Greater than or Equal to >=
    - Lesser than or Equal to <=
* Assignment Operators
    - 
    - Assignment =
    - Addition Assignment +=
    - Subtraction Assignment -=
    - Multiplication Assignment *=
    - Division Assignment /=
    - Remainder Assignment %=
    - Exponent Assignment **=
* Logical Operators
    - 
    - AND &&
    - OR ||
    - NOT !

# Interpreter V/S Complier
* Interpreter
    - Interpreters execute code line-by-line. JS, Python use interpreter.
    - Uses REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment.
* Compilers
    - Compilers translate the entire source code before execution. C, C++, Java, and Swift use compiler. 

# Conditional Statements
* if 
    - Checks the condition and run the code in its block
    - If the conditon is false , nothing happens
* if-else
    - First the condition is checked and if the condition is true than the block of if is executed.
    - If the condition of if is false then the block of else if used.
* if , else if , else
    - Here we can proveide multiple conditions and the condition which is true , it's block is executed.
    - First if's block, then else if , at last else.

# Loops 
* for loop

* for in loop

* for of loop

* while loop

* do while loop

# Control Statements (Loop control statements)
* Break
    -

* Continue 
    -
# Scope of variable
*  Difference between LET VAR and CONST
    -

* Global Scope
    -

* Local Scope
    -
    - Block Scope
    - Function Scope

# Concept of Hoisting

# Type casting

# Working with String and its functions

# Working with Array and its functions

# Concept of DOM(Document object Model)
