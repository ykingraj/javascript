# What is GIGO
- GIGO stands for "Garbage In, Garbage Out." It is a principle in computing and data processing that emphasizes the importance of input quality. The principle states that if invalid, incorrect, or poor-quality input data (garbage) is provided to a system, the output (results) will also be flawed, inaccurate, or meaningless (garbage).

# What is programming 
- Programming is the process of designing and building computer programs or scripts to accomplish specific tasks or solve problems. It involves writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute to perform desired operations. Programming languages are used to communicate these instructions to the computer.

# Components of a website / web devlopmment
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in web development. Each of these technologies plays a distinct role in creating and managing the structure, style, and behavior of a website.  

# Intro to JS
- JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for web development. Initially created to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, it has evolved into a versatile language that can be used both on the client-side (in web browsers) and server-side (with platforms like Node.js). JavaScript is known for its flexibility, as it supports various programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
Role: Structure and Content
    -
    - provides the structure and content, defining the layout and elements of the page.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
Role: Presentation and Style
    -
    -styles the HTML elements, controlling the visual appearance.

- JavaScript
Role: Interactivity and Behavior
    -
    -adds interactivity, making the web page responsive to user actions.

# Variables
* Containers for holding values
* Concept of LET VAR and CONST
* Naming rules 
* Case Sensitive 
* Cant start with number
* Can be combination of String and Numbers
* Javascript is a dynamicly typed language, which means the single variable can be assigned different values throught out the programm (different datatypes).
They are processed during the runtime.
 
# Data types
* Primitive Datatypes 
    -
    - String
    - Numbers
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
* Non Primitive Datatypes
    -
    - Array
    - Objects
    - Functions
    - Sets
    - Maps
* Special Datatype
    -
    - BigInt

# Operatores
* Arithmetic Operators
    - 
    - Addition +
    - Subtraction -
    - Division /
    - Multiplication *
    - Exponent **
    - Modules or Remainder %
    - Increment ++
    - Decrement --
    - Post and Pre increment/decrement (++x vs x++)
* Comparison Operators
    - 
    - Equal ==
    - Strict Equal ===
    - Greater than >
    - Lesser than <
    - Not Equal !=
    - Strict Not Equal !==
    - Greater than or Equal to >=
    - Lesser than or Equal to <=
* Assignment Operators
    - 
    - Assignment =
    - Addition Assignment +=
    - Subtraction Assignment -=
    - Multiplication Assignment *=
    - Division Assignment /=
    - Remainder Assignment %=
    - Exponent Assignment **=
* Logical Operators
    - 
    - AND &&
    - OR ||
    - NOT !

# Interpreter V/S Complier
* Interpreter
    - Interpreters execute code line-by-line. JS, Python use interpreter.
    - Uses REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment.
* Compilers
    - Compilers translate the entire source code before execution. C, C++, Java, and Swift use compiler. 

# Conditional Statements
* if 
    - Checks the condition and run the code in its block
    - If the conditon is false , nothing happens
* if-else
    - First the condition is checked and if the condition is true than the block of if is executed.
    - If the condition of if is false then the block of else if used.
* if , else if , else
    - Here we can proveide multiple conditions and the condition which is true , it's block is executed.
    - First if's block, then else if , at last else.

# Index
* for string
* for array
# Loops 
* for loop
    - The for loop is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration statement.
    - for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

* for in loop
    - loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.
    - for (variable in object) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

* for of loop
    -  is used to iterate over iterable objects such as arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
    - for (variable of iterable) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

* while loop
    - loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
    - while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
    }

* do while loop
    - The do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is evaluated after executing the block of code, meaning the block of code will always execute at least once.
    - do {
    // code block to be executed
    } while (condition);

# Control Statements (Loop control statements)
* Break
    -

* Continue

# Scope of variable
*  Difference between LET VAR and CONST

* Global Scope

* Local Scope

    - Block Scope
    - Function Scope
